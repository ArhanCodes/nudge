# Nudge

Nudge is a personalised sustainability tracker to nudge better habits.

I'm building it for my EPQ. The project explores the question: "To what extent can a personalised digital tool influence individual sustainable behaviour change across multiple environmental domains?"

### What it does
Nudge lets users track their daily habits across four sustainability domains (transport, diet, energy use, and waste). Each activity is converted into a real CO₂e score using emissions data, giving users a clear picture of their environmental footprint over time.

### Features

- Daily habit logging across transport, diet, energy & waste
- Carbon footprint calculator using real emissions data (kg CO₂e)
- Personalised weekly tips based on your worst-performing category
- Progress dashboard with charts showing improvement over time
- Streak & badge system to keep you consistent
